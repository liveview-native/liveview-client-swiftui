/// Live bindings provide a mechanism for sharing state between the server and client in a way that can be updated by either.
///
/// Updates to the value from the client-side will automatically send an event to the server to update its stored value.
/// Likewise, whenever the value is updated on the server, an event will be sent to the client which will trigger the `@LiveBinding` to update and the SwiftUI view that contains it (as well as any that use the ``projectedValue`` binding) to re-render.
///
/// ### Binding Names
/// The name of a live binding is not defined directly by the client.
/// Instead, it is always controlled by the backend, to prevent the name getting out-of-sync, especially when multiple client versions may be in use.
///
/// Depending on how the live binding is used, the name is obtained in one of two ways:
/// 1. If it is being used as part of an element, the binding name is provided by an attribute on the element.
/// Pass the name of the attribute which specifies the binding name to the ``LiveBinding/init(attribute:)`` initializer.
/// 2. If it is being used as part of a view modifier, the binding name is encoded as a string in the modifier payload.
/// Decode the binding using the ``init(decoding:in:initialValue:)`` initializer, and the string value at the given coding key will be used as the binding name.
///
/// See below for examples of both use cases.
///
/// In either case, if the binding name is not provided, the `LiveBinding` operates in local mode (that is, like a regular SwiftUI `@State` property, not connected to the backend).
/// When in local mode, an initial value for the property must be provided (see the respective initializers for how), otherwise accessing the live binding will crash.
///
/// ### Server Support
/// As live bindings are a two-way mechanism, they are not implemented purely on the client, but rather require server-side support.
///
/// The server sends an event on mount with all of the binding values, sends an event when a binding is changed, and handles an event when a binding is changed on the client. These are all provided by the [`live_view_native_swift_ui`](https://github.com/liveviewnative/live_view_native_swift_ui) Elixir package.
///
/// The `bindings` macro takes a keyword list of bindings and their initial values and automatically generates all the necessary supporting code.
/// The Elixir value used for the initial binding value must be serializable as JSON.
///
/// ```elixir
/// defmodule AppWeb.TestLive do
///     use AppWeb, :live_view
///     use LiveViewNativeSwiftUi.Bindings
///
///     bindings(toggle_binding: false, alert_shown: false)
/// end
/// ```
///
/// Then, in the template, the same name is given as the value of a binding attribute:
///
/// ```html
/// <my-toggle is-on="toggle_binding" />
///
/// <button modifiers='[{"type": "my_alert", "is_active": "alert_shown"}]'>
///     <text>Present alert</text>
/// </button>
/// ```
///
/// ### Client Usage
/// To use this property wrapper, the wrapped type must impelement the `Codable` protocol to define how values are serialized over the network.
///
/// ```swift
/// struct MyToggle: View {
///     @LiveBinding(attribute: "is-on") private var isOn: Bool
///
///     var body: some View {
///         Toggle(isOn: $isOn) {
///             Text("My Toggle")
///         }
///     }
/// }
///
/// struct MyAlertModifier: ViewModifier, Decodable {
///     @LiveBinding private var isActive: Bool
///
///     init(from decoder: Decoder) throws {
///         let container = try decoder.container(keyedBy: CodingKeys.self)
///         self._isActive = try LiveBinding(decoding: .isActive, in: container)
///     }
///
///     func body(content: Content) -> some View {
///         content
///             .alert("Hello", isPresented: $isActive) {
///                 Button("OK") {}
///             }
///     }
///
///     enum CodingKeys: String, CodingKey {
///         case isActive = "is_active"
///     }
/// }
/// ```
